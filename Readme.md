# Python
Hi!

I'm currently figuring out some easy to use scrapers, simply open up your CLI, download any script and run it from there. Was always having endless tabs open and wanted to find a way to not have endless tabs open and get information fast and easy.

# Github Userdata.py
This one is the first one I put together. When using this, make sure you got the libraries and Python3 installed. 

If you need to install Python3 the easiest way is to do this through https://www.python.org/downloads/ 

If you have Python already installed, make sure to check if pip is up to date: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/

# How to use it?

Step 1: Download the file

Step 2: Move it to a directory or folder that is easy to find whilst in your CLI

Step 3: Open your CLI

Step 4: Enter: pip install requests (if pip command gives you an error type pip3)

Step 5: Navigate to the directory or folder where the file is located by typing: cd yourfoldername

Step 6: Whilst in your directory, type python3 userdata.py

You should be able to see the first question and are able to make a request, and exit as well.

I'm looking into updating this so it exports into a CSV or a google sheet. Perhaps if I go really wild I'll look into storing this in a PostGreSQL DB.
